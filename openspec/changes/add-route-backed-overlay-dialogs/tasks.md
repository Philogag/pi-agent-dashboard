# Tasks — add-route-backed-overlay-dialogs

Groups 1–2 are **already implemented and verified** (2335 tests green, `tsc`
clean, zero new `kb dox lint` findings). They are the contract and manifest
layer; `presentation` is inert until group 4 lands a consumer.

Groups 3+ are unstarted. **Sequencing note (R5):** `collapse-pairing-into-gateway`
is in-progress, deletes `PairingView.tsx` / `QrCodeDialog.tsx`, and edits
`SettingsPanel.tsx` — which group 5 also edits. Land it first, or task 5.5
becomes mandatory.

## 1. Plugin claim contract — `presentation`

- [x] 1.1 Add `presentation?: "page" | "dialog"` to `PluginClaim` in `packages/shared/src/dashboard-plugin/manifest-types.ts`, documenting the default (`"dialog"`) and the mobile opt-out (D3a)
- [x] 1.2 Add `presentation` to `ClaimEntry` in `packages/dashboard-plugin-runtime/src/slot-registry.ts`
- [x] 1.3 Validate `presentation` in `packages/dashboard-plugin-runtime/src/manifest-validator.ts` — FATAL on an unrecognised value, not warn-and-default (D3)
- [x] 1.4 Emit `presentation` from the registry codegen in `packages/dashboard-plugin-runtime/src/vite-plugin/index.ts`
- [x] 1.5 Regenerate `packages/client/src/generated/plugin-registry.tsx` with `NODE_ENV=production` (dev-mode regen injects the `demo` fixture plugin)

## 2. Bundled manifests declare reachable back targets

- [x] 2.1 Write `packages/shared/src/__tests__/overlay-claims-declare-depth.test.ts` — scans every bundled manifest for missing `depth`, `depth: 2` without `parentPath`, and uninterpolable `parentPath`; includes a vacuity guard. Verify it fails before the fixes
- [x] 2.2 `goal-plugin`: board → `depth: 2` + `parentPath: /folder/:encodedCwd`; detail → `depth: 2` + `parentPath: /folder/:encodedCwd/goals`
- [x] 2.3 `kb-plugin`: `depth: 2` + `parentPath: /folder/:encodedCwd`
- [x] 2.4 `subagents-plugin`: `depth: 2` + `parentPath: /session/:sessionId`
- [x] 2.5 Re-parent the automation run monitor to `/folder/:encodedCwd/automations/run/:sid` so its `parentPath` is interpolable (D4b); update `AutomationRunMonitor.tsx`, `client/index.tsx`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the `route-descriptor.ts` stale example
- [x] 2.6 Update the tests that pinned the old shape: `route-descriptors.test.ts` (degradation case → synthetic path), `back-target.test.ts` (cold-load now resolves to the board), `back-regression.test.ts`
- [x] 2.7 Confirm the guard test is green and no new `kb dox lint` findings were introduced
- [x] 2.8 **Regression fix.** The first attempt declared the Goals/KB boards `depth: 1`, which was WORSE than declaring nothing: the omitted-depth default is 2, which satisfies the strictly-shallower history fast-path against a depth-1 folder, while an explicit 1 loses it and resolves to `/`. Corrected to `depth: 2` + `parentPath`
- [x] 2.9 `automation-plugin`: board → `depth: 2` + `parentPath: /folder/:encodedCwd` for consistency with Goals/KB; update the shipped `back-target.test.ts` / `back-regression.test.ts` fixtures and the `url-routing` scenario that pinned `depth: 1 → /`
- [x] 2.10 Add `packages/client/src/lib/nav/__tests__/overlay-claim-back-targets.test.ts` — walks the REAL generated registry and resolves each nested claim's back action through `computeBackTarget`/`goBack` on both the in-app and cold-load paths. Catches the `depth: 1`-under-a-depth-1-parent and uninterpolable-`parentPath` classes, which the manifest-scan test cannot. **Known limit:** the expectation is derived from the claim's own declared `parentPath`, so a semantically wrong but interpolable `parentPath` still passes

## 3. Route-backed overlay renderer

- [ ] 3.1 Build the route-backed overlay renderer: desktop `Dialog` over a plain backdrop, mobile falls through to `MobileShell` depth. This is a NEW mechanism — `OpenSpecArtifactDialog` is local-state and is not a reusable precedent (D1)
- [ ] 3.2 Implement dismissal as "leave this surface", NOT a single `history.back()` — unwind the surface's own pushed entries or navigate to the tracked launching route (D1a)
- [ ] 3.3 Implement the cold-load dismissal path: no tracked predecessor → resolve the target from the `RouteDescriptor` table, never a no-op
- [ ] 3.4 Ensure lazy mount on match and full unmount on dismissal — no retained subscriptions or polling behind a closed overlay (R4)
- [ ] 3.5 Confirm nothing renders behind the dialog, keeping `shell-overlay-route:145` and `url-routing:259+` true as written
- [ ] 3.6 Decide and implement the backdrop treatment (scrim over blank vs over the card list) — open question in design.md
- [ ] 3.7 Use an existing `--z-*` token rather than a raw z-index so `scripts/z-layer-lint.mjs` stays green
- [ ] 3.8 Unit-test the renderer against the `url-routing` "Route-backed overlay container" scenarios

## 4. Plugin overlays render as dialogs

- [ ] 4.1 Make `ShellOverlayRouteSlot` in `packages/dashboard-plugin-runtime/src/slot-consumers.tsx` select its container from the claim's effective `presentation` — this is the single edit that converts Automation, Goals, KB, and the subagent popout (D2). `flows-plugin` declares no such claim
- [ ] 4.2 Preserve the existing height-propagation wrapper contract for both containers
- [ ] 4.3 Honour `presentation: "page"` on desktop **and** mobile (D3a) — full viewport, outside the `MobileShell` panel
- [ ] 4.4 Confirm the mobile path still walks the depth table, so group 2's declarations remain load-bearing (D4)
- [ ] 4.5 Document `presentation` for plugin authors so the opt-out is discoverable (R3)
- [ ] 4.6 Enforce in the validator the rule the specs now state: `presentation: "page"` requires `depth`; `parentPath` is required whenever `depth: 2` (not as an extra `"page"` condition); and a claim nested under `/folder/:cwd` or `/session/:id` must not declare `depth: 1`
- [ ] 4.7 Extend e2e coverage of `shell-overlay-route` claims beyond the automation board (`tests/e2e/automation-fanout.spec.ts:94` is the only existing one); `blackhole-plugin`, the assumed canary, declares only a `settings-section` claim

## 5. Convert core surfaces

- [ ] 5.1 `/settings/:page/:sub?` onto the overlay renderer
- [ ] 5.2 `/folder/:cwd/settings/:page` onto the overlay renderer
- [ ] 5.3 `/folder/:cwd/view?path=`, `/pi-view?url=`, `/pi-resource?path=` onto the overlay renderer (reparent `PreviewOverlayView`)
- [ ] 5.4 `/tunnel-setup` as its own route-backed overlay; verify it REPLACES rather than stacks on settings, and that dismissal returns to `/settings/gateway` (D5)
- [ ] 5.5 **Only if `collapse-pairing-into-gateway` has not landed:** make `navigate("/settings/...")` from inside the settings dialog switch the dialog's page without closing it, so `PairingView`'s empty-state jump cannot strand a live one-time-code TTL (R5)
- [ ] 5.6 Delete the duplicate full-page OpenSpec artifact path; `OpenSpecArtifactDialog` becomes the only renderer (D6)
- [ ] 5.7 Confirm `/folder/:cwd/openspec`, `/session/:id/diff`, `/session/:id/editor`, and `/pair` are untouched
- [ ] 5.8 Update the `back-target.ts` descriptor table only where a depth actually changed — paths must not move

## 6. Dirty-state guard (R1 — highest severity)

- [ ] 6.1 Write failing tests: backdrop-click and `Esc` on a dirty settings surface must not discard edits
- [ ] 6.2 Wire `SettingsPanel`'s `isDirty` to the overlay's dismissal gestures — prompt or persist, never silently discard
- [ ] 6.3 Change the discard-confirm target from the hardcoded `setPendingNav("/")` (`SettingsPanel.tsx:899`) to the launching route — today it evicts to the card list, re-creating the defect this change exists to fix (D1b)
- [ ] 6.4 Extend the guard to `DirectorySettings/InstructionsPage`, which holds its own dirty state and does not thread through `SettingsPanel` (D1b)
- [ ] 6.5 Verify a clean surface still dismisses immediately with no prompt

## 7. Resource surface dedupe

- [ ] 7.1 Collapse the global and folder `ResourceGridPanel` call sites into one scope-switched surface deriving scope set, filter visibility, and file-view target from the matched route (D7)
- [ ] 7.2 Verify all ten resource paths still resolve and render the type named in the path
- [ ] 7.3 Verify exactly one `ResourceGridPanel` mounts per matched route

## 8. Verification

- [ ] 8.1 Run the full suite in CI (it exceeds the local 900s budget and hits a `parallelize-test-harness` port limit locally)
- [ ] 8.2 Run the e2e suite unchanged — **no `goto(...)` target may need editing**; any required edit falsifies D1 and the change must stop
- [ ] 8.3 `doubt-driven-review` on the "containers change, URLs do not" claim against the full route table, before the renderer lands
- [ ] 8.4 `security-hardening`: confirm no pairing affordance moved onto a path that skips `guardPairingUrls`, and TLS-only `urls[]` handling is unaffected
- [ ] 8.5 `performance-optimization`: confirm converted surfaces mount lazily and unmount on dismissal
- [ ] 8.6 `code-simplification`: confirm the renderer did not absorb the complexity removed from the ten resource routes
- [ ] 8.7 `review-code` across client, plugin runtime, and shared contract
- [ ] 8.8 Manual mobile pass: every converted surface still slides in as a depth panel with working swipe-back

## 9. Follow-ups (explicitly out of scope)

- [ ] 9.1 File a separate change for the orphaned automation run monitor — re-parenting fixed its back action, but no in-app producer navigates to it, so it is reachable by URL only (D4b)
- [ ] 9.2 File a separate change for `/session/:id/diff` and `/session/:id/editor` as `SplitWorkspace` panes

## 10. Tests — folded from test-plan.md

Every `automated` row in `test-plan.md` maps to exactly one task here; every
`manual-only` row maps to one task in group 11. Each carries a harness-exemplar
pointer to copy glue from, the scenario Triple, and its manifest id.

### 10a. Claim contract — L1 (`packages/dashboard-plugin-runtime/src/__tests__/manifest-validator.test.ts`)

- [x] 10.1 Valid `presentation: "dialog"` passes through to the normalised claim. Triple: claim with presentation dialog · validator runs · normalised claim carries presentation === "dialog" (test-plan #S-01). See `manifest-validator.test.ts`
- [x] 10.2 Valid `presentation: "page"` passes through. Triple: claim with presentation page · validator runs · `ClaimEntry.presentation === "page"` (test-plan #S-02). See `manifest-validator.test.ts`
- [x] 10.3 Unrecognised `presentation` is fatal, not warn-and-default. Triple: claim with presentation "modal" · validator runs · throws ManifestValidationError naming the accepted values (test-plan #S-03). See `manifest-validator.test.ts`
- [x] 10.4 Omitted `presentation` validates and is left undefined for the shell to default. Triple: claim with no presentation key · validator runs · succeeds, presentation undefined (test-plan #S-04). See `manifest-validator.test.ts`
- [x] 10.5 Non-string `presentation` is rejected rather than coerced. Triple: claim with presentation 42 · validator runs · throws ManifestValidationError (test-plan #S-05). See `manifest-validator.test.ts`
- [ ] 10.6 Registry codegen emits `presentation` and excludes the demo fixture. Triple: manifest with presentation page · NODE_ENV=production codegen runs · generated registry carries presentation top-level and contains no demo plugin (test-plan #S-06). See `packages/shared/src/__tests__/bundled-plugins-complete.test.ts` for the repo-scan idiom

### 10b. Overlay container — L3 (`tests/e2e/openspec-artifact-dialog.spec.ts` is the nearest dialog exemplar; `tests/e2e/overlay-layering.spec.ts` for layering; `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts` for route walking)

- [ ] 10.7 Settings renders in a dialog container on desktop. Triple: desktop viewport at /session/<id> · navigate to /settings/general · settings renders in a dialog, URL exactly /settings/general (test-plan #S-07, blocked on clarification C1). See `tests/e2e/openspec-artifact-dialog.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.8 No lower-priority branch renders behind the dialog. Triple: desktop at /settings/general · surface rendered · session-detail content absent from the DOM (test-plan #S-08). See `tests/e2e/openspec-artifact-dialog.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.9 Esc returns to the launching route. Triple: opened /settings/general from /session/<id> · press Esc · URL returns to /session/<id> and chat renders (test-plan #S-09, see clarification C2). See `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.10 One dismissal leaves the surface even after an in-panel history push. Triple: opened /settings/general from /session/<id> then navigated to /settings/plugins/<id> · press Esc once · URL returns to /session/<id>, not /settings/general (test-plan #S-10). See `tests/e2e/plugin-settings-pages.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.11 Cold-loaded surface dismisses via the descriptor table. Triple: fresh goto /settings/security with no predecessor · dismiss · resolves a defined target, not a no-op (test-plan #S-11). See `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.12 Route-backed surfaces replace rather than stack. Triple: at /settings/gateway · navigate to /tunnel-setup · exactly one overlay mounted, settings not mounted simultaneously (test-plan #S-12). See `tests/e2e/zrok-v2-tunnel.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.13 Tunnel dismissal returns to settings. Triple: opened /tunnel-setup from /settings/gateway · dismiss · URL returns to /settings/gateway and settings renders (test-plan #S-13). See `tests/e2e/zrok-v2-tunnel.spec.ts`

### 10c. Dirty-state guard — L3 (`tests/e2e/plugin-settings-pages.spec.ts`)

- [ ] 10.14 Backdrop click with unsaved edits prompts. Triple: settings Instructions page with an unsaved edit · click backdrop · discard prompt appears, edit not discarded (test-plan #S-14, see clarification C3). See `tests/e2e/plugin-settings-pages.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.15 Esc with unsaved edits prompts. Triple: same unsaved edit · press Esc · discard prompt appears (test-plan #S-15). See `tests/e2e/plugin-settings-pages.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.16 Clean surface dismisses with no prompt. Triple: settings open with no unsaved edits · press Esc · closes immediately, no prompt (test-plan #S-16). See `tests/e2e/plugin-settings-pages.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.17 Discard confirmation returns to the launching route, not the card list. Triple: opened settings from /session/<id>, unsaved edit · dismiss then confirm discard · URL becomes /session/<id>, not / (test-plan #S-17). See `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.18 Folder instructions editor is covered by the same guard. Triple: /folder/<cwd>/settings/instructions with an unsaved edit · dismiss via backdrop · discard prompt appears (test-plan #S-18). See `tests/e2e/directory-home.spec.ts`

### 10d. Back-target correctness — L1 (`packages/client/src/lib/nav/__tests__/overlay-claim-back-targets.test.ts`, `packages/client/src/lib/__tests__/back-target.test.ts`)

- [x] 10.19 A nested claim declared depth 1 resolves to `/`, pinning why nested claims use depth 2. Triple: claim /folder/:encodedCwd/thing depth 1, predecessor /folder/<cwd> depth 1 · goBack · resolves to / (test-plan #S-19). See `back-target.test.ts`
- [x] 10.20 Every nested registry claim resolves to its owning parent on both paths. Triple: each nested shell-overlay-route claim · resolve back in-app and cold-load · both reach the owning parent, neither yields / (test-plan #S-20). See `overlay-claim-back-targets.test.ts`
- [x] 10.21 An uninterpolable parentPath fails the manifest scan. Triple: claim /x/run/:sid with parentPath needing :encodedCwd · scan test runs · fails naming the unsuppliable param (test-plan #S-21). See `packages/shared/src/__tests__/overlay-claims-declare-depth.test.ts`
- [x] 10.22 The manifest scan is not vacuous. Triple: scan returns an empty claim list · scan test runs · fails rather than passing over zero claims (test-plan #S-22). See `overlay-claims-declare-depth.test.ts`
- [ ] 10.23 Mobile swipe-back from the Goals board returns to the folder. Triple: mobile, opened /folder/<cwd>/goals from /folder/<cwd> · swipe-back · returns to /folder/<cwd>, not / (test-plan #S-23). See `tests/e2e/gateway-board-mobile.spec.ts` for the mobile-viewport idiom
- [x] 10.24 Run monitor backs to its board via computeParent, pinning the R7 depth-model limit. Triple: at the run URL with the board as tracked predecessor · goBack · navigates to the board, history.back() not used (test-plan #S-24). See `packages/client/src/lib/__tests__/back-regression.test.ts`

### 10e. Resource dedupe — L3 (`tests/e2e/resource-activation-trust.spec.ts`)

- [ ] 10.25 All ten resource paths resolve to the type named in the path. Triple: each of the 10 settings/folder-settings resource paths · open each · renders its named type, none 404s or falls through (test-plan #S-25, see clarification C4). See `tests/e2e/resource-activation-trust.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.26 Exactly one ResourceGridPanel mounts per matched route. Triple: any resource route open as an overlay · render · one grid mounted (test-plan #S-26). See `tests/e2e/resource-activation-trust.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.27 Scope and filter follow the matched route. Triple: /settings/skills vs /folder/<cwd>/settings/skills · open each · global hides the filter, folder shows local+global with it (test-plan #S-27). See `tests/e2e/skill-provenance.spec.ts`

### 10f. Lifecycle and performance

- [ ] 10.28 A dismissed overlay releases its subscriptions. Triple: converted surface holding a live subscription · dismiss · unmounts and unsubscribes (assert the unsubscribe call, not a timer) (test-plan #S-28). L1, see `packages/client/src/lib/__tests__/back-regression.test.ts` for the module-level harness idiom
- [ ] 10.29 Overlay open latency stays within budget. Triple: desktop with a session open · open+dismiss settings 20x · p95 open-to-rendered under the stated budget (test-plan #S-29, blocked on clarification C5). L3, see `tests/e2e/chat-render-perf.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.30 Repeated open/dismiss does not leak. Triple: open+dismiss each converted surface 100x · measure RSS before/after · growth under the stated budget (test-plan #S-30, blocked on clarification C5). L2, see `qa/tests/16-e2e-memory-bound.sh`

### 10g. URL-preservation gate and resilience

- [ ] 10.31 The existing e2e suite passes with zero goto edits. Triple: unmodified e2e suite · run against the converted build · passes with no goto target changed; any required edit falsifies D1 and stops the change (test-plan #S-31). See the whole of `tests/e2e/`
- [ ] 10.32 A missing preview target renders the error state, not a blank dialog. Triple: deep-link /folder/<cwd>/view?path=<missing> as an overlay · open · error/fallback renders, no unhandled rejection (test-plan #S-32). See `tests/e2e/file-preview-survives-churn.spec.ts`

### 10h. Pairing (contract 4)

- [ ] 10.33 A live pairing code survives navigation across overlays. Triple: live one-time code from the gateway surface · navigate away to another overlay and back · code still valid within TTL or cleanly re-issued, never silently dead (test-plan #S-33). See `tests/e2e/pairing-qr.spec.ts`
- [ ] 10.34 No converted route bypasses the pairing guard. Triple: every converted route path · check against guardPairingUrls · no pairing affordance on a bypassing path (test-plan #S-34). L1, see `packages/server/src/__tests__/` for the guard's existing coverage

## 11. Manual verification (deferred post-merge)

- [ ] 11.1 On a real phone, open and dismiss each converted surface; the slide-in and swipe-back feel native with no jank at the dialog/depth-panel boundary (test-plan: manual-only)
- [ ] 11.2 At desktop widths the settings overlay reads as an overlay rather than a cramped page, with no visual truncation (test-plan: manual-only)
